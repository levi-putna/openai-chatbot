# openai-chatbot

Hi there!

This code is actually part of an article series that focuses on creating AI chatbot assistants with the help of OpenAI's api. If you're interested in learning more, you can check out the [article](www.twistedbrackets.com/openai-chatgpt-vs-gpt/) and even follow along with the tutorial.

In order to run this script during development, simply use the command `yarn start`. If you want to make changes and have the server automatically restart, you can use `yarn start:dev` and nodemon will take care of the rest!

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
